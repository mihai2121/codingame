============================
_Solving the challenges and contests hosted on CodinGame._

Usage
-----
The execution and testing of these solutions happens in the CodinGame IDE.
Some of these may be a work in progress, and thus, they may not pass the tests.
Still, please do attempt each game before referencing its material.

Purpose
-------
Left unchecked the blades of mental hack foo start to dull.
Due to this phenomenon, this project aims to hone my skills as a multi-lingual programmer.
